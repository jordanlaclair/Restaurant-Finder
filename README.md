## Technologies

## Overview

This is my first fullstack project so I especially learned a lot about the back-end, specifically with Express, Node.js, and connecting to a database (in this case PostgreSQL).
I as well got to get very familiar with Redux and React Router. I first developed the full stack app locally by creating a RESTful API and then when I was finished I used Heroku for production / hosting.
